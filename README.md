This is a personal game I was making. A place where I could live out my dreams
and events in my life. My hope is that in the course of over a few decades
it will be something that will culminate my experiences into a greater work of
art. Hopefully, people will be able to play it and live through the things that
I have lived through.

Most of all though, it is a place where creativity has no bounds. I wish this
project to allow myself a space where I can channel my energies and emotions
and thoughts into a whole.
